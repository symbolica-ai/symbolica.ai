# SymChat

SymChat is a chatbot currently under development which uses Symbolica models to organize, understand, and answer questions using the data you care about. Rather than being trained on a static corpus of text like other large language models, SymChat is trained on the fly with data you provide.

You could, for instance, train SymChat on an author's works and ask it to explain the actions of a character or the plot of a story, or pass it a live feed of Wikipedia changes and have a chatbot with an always up-to-date knowledge base. You could even have a friend write their own murder mystery before sharing it with you to investigate and unravel.

SymChat models have persistent memory rather than just a fixed token buffer and can be forked, updated, and merged in order to share or combine knowledge.
