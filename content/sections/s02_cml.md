# Deep Tech

At its core Symbolica is a deep tech company focused on the development of machine learning models that are fundamentally different than neural networks. We believe that the golden age of deep learning is drawing to a close, as state of the art models prove to be too compute and data hungry to be sustainable over the coming years. A step change in the way we approach ML is necessary to realize the future of AI that so many are reaching for.

Symbolica builds upon the geometric and topological underpinnings of machine learning to train models using a formal computational logic rather than statistical methods. By analyzing data discretely, Symbolica models better understand causal relationships within data and are well equipped to make reasoning based decisions using that causality.
